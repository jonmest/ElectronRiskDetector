# Electron Risk Detector
Electron JS is a framework which allows you to build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS . However, those great powers come with greater responsibility. Running an application straight on an users desktop instead of just in a browser creates potential for some pretty ugly issues.

This applications strives to help developers working in Electron to avoid the most common and serious risks within the framework. It will not detect all issues, and like most static analysis tools it will have a high rate of false positives, but it is automatic and may lighten your load a bit

## How to use:
1. `python3 main.py <path-to-directory-of-electron-project>`
